This weekend I turned 34. When friends or family have birthdays, I like to ask them what they're excited for in the coming year. Today someone flipped the question on me, and this is what I answered.

<!-- more -->

A few months ago someone told me that suffering is inherent to the human experience, because we always want things, and as soon as we have something, we begin wanting something else. "Skill issue," I shot back, "I would simply acquire the things I want, and then continue to enjoy them."

I am a very happy and satisfied 34 year old. My wife and I love each other, are committed to each other, and work hard for each other. I have a daughter who I'm simply obsessed with. When she shrieks and giggles at me, my heart skips beats.

I have a mum and dad who are proud of me, and although we live in different countries, I see them at least twice a year. I am raising my daughter how they raised me, and I am very grateful for everything they've given me. My grandparents have met their great-granddaughter. I watched her give my grandfather a high-five.

I have a job that challenges me, lets me travel around the world talking about fun projects at conferences, and lets me support my wife through grad school. Now that she's graduated (with her PhD, if I may brag), we make enough to feed our daughter and start thinking about the next kid.

Every morning, I have enough time to make breakfast for my kid and my wife, and I usually have enough time to make dinner for them too.

I know that as I get older I will probably want more and more. But I currently wake up every day, grateful that I have a family, and enough time and money to provide for them. I did not expect I would have this life at 34, and I am going to try not to lose sight of that.
