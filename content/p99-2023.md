I had a great time presenting at [P99Conf]! I watch their talks every year and I always learn a lot. I was really thrilled to present a talk at this year's conference. It's heavily based on my blog post [Why use Rust on the backend?][rust-backend]. If you missed the talk, you can watch the recording or view the slides [here][my talk].
