I'll be at RustConf 2024, speaking about KCL, the 3D manufacturing language we're building at [Zoo.dev](https://zoo.dev)!
I'm really excited to present, and to meet a lot of other Rustaceans. If you're going to be in Montreal,
send me a message or email (contact details [here](/about)) and let's make sure we say hi.
