Hi, I'm Adam Chalmers. I'm an Australian living in Austin, Texas with my wife, dog and daughter. I helped
build parts of Cloudflare's "Zero Trust" product, including Cloudflare Tunnel and our Data Loss Prevention
suite. Now I work at [Zoo.dev](https://zoo.dev) building KittyCAD. You can find me on:
