Hi all! Allen Wyma of [Rustacean Station] had me on the podcast to talk about Rust at Cloudflare. We cover why and how Cloudflare started using Rust, how my team specifically works with Rust, and how Cloudflare works. We also go on a big tangent about social security numbers. Give [the episode] a listen if you'd like.
