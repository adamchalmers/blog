Kris Jenkins of [Developer Voices] spoke to me on his podcast! We talked about KittyCAD and its language, which I'm building for my work at [Zoo].

You can listen to it wherever you get your podcasts, or watch it on YouTube. Thanks so much for having me on your podcast, Kris! Developer Voices has become my favourite tech podcast and I really love the range of people he talks to. Kris goes deep and is scared of getting into the technical nitty-gritty, unlike some other tech podcasts I've tried. I strongly recommend listening to his archive!
